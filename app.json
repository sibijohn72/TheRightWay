For example, if the registration is transferrable to another SCB person, then the Company can keep the “gift” and management can determine who, if anyone, attends. If the registration is not transferrable, then management should decide if it is of value to the Company to send you or not.  If the department is willing to cover the other travel expenses, then the Company can use it.  If management is not willing to cover the extra costs, it will be considered a “gift” to you which you cannot accept (assuming it is worth more than nominal value).",

		"answer": "Generally, you are not permitted to have more than one supplier-paid meal per week.

The purpose of allowing SCB personnel to accept invitations to socialize with a supplier is to enhance business relationships.

Since you aren’t responsible for the bid process, you don’t know whether or not the supplier is entitled to the information. She may be using it to get an advantage over the other bidders.

		"answer": "First tell your friends to stop sending emails to your work email. If you want to receive this type of message, have them send it to your personal email account.  If you suspect that a personal email contains inappropriate material, do not open it from your work computer – others may see it when they walk by your desk and copies of it will be on the SCB system.  Delete potentially inappropriate email without opening, and send a note back to your friends reminding them to send it to your personal email.",

Is it OK to pass on the information even though I am at work?",
		"answer": "Making a quick call like this on an infrequent basis is not a problem.  If you need to send an email about this, do it from your personal account.  Handling calls for your parents on a more frequent basis, however, is not an acceptable use of Company assets – including your time.",

SCB supports various educational projects, so this is like them supporting the school.  Do you agree?",
		"answer": "No.  The decision whether the Company will give support to an educational program is not an individual’s decision, it is a decision made by the Company.  Printing stacks of materials related to outside work, and using your laptop as a significant resource for non-SCB work, is using Company assets to support your personal business.

Taking photos and other recording is only allowed under Directive C-114 for certain purposes and making recordings of meetings where business is discussed and decisions are made is not an approved use.

I am told by the new dealer that if SCB would <u>hire the son of a local governor</u>, he is sure that the process would be done quickly.  The son recently graduated from a respected university. Should I recommend the official’s son for hire?",
		"answer": "No, do not recommend to anyone that SCB hire the government official’s son. Instead, politely point the person to the Company’s recruiting process and do not take any steps to assist in recommending the official’s son for a position. Pushing to hire the family member of an official can be considered a form of bribery, so ensure that you do not take special steps to recommend the official’s son and instead let the normal hiring process take its course. You should also contact the Corporate Compliance Office to document the situation and our response.You should follow this advice regardless if the request comes from a dealer, supplier, a government representative or other advisor.",

		"answer": "No, lending a Company vehicle to a government official for personal use is a favor and could be seen as a bribe.  Under some circumstances, it may be appropriate to provide transportation for demonstration purposes or to assist a government agency in unusual situations.

The government employee I have been working with advised me that if I <u>paid her an additional $20 fee for the permits</u> she could speed up the process and have them ready in 10 days.  Can I pay the $20 fee to ensure the grand opening happens smoothly?",
		"answer": "No, you may not pay any unofficial fee to the government employee.  If you are having difficulties, contact your local legal office, Corporate Compliance Office, or Government Affairs for help.  Making such a payment not only exposes SCB to fines and legal costs, it also results in local officials expecting small bribes in the future – resulting in more operating costs for the Company and potentially other members of the community.",

Anything more than light refreshments or a basic meal for a government official requires pre-approval from the Corporate Compliance Office in Dearborn.

A critical subset of PII is Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII), and it is entitled to additional protection.

So it's not just a slogan, it's not just something printed on a card – it's something that we live every day. It's part of our natural One SCB behaviors.</p><p><b>Narrator:</b> Doing the right thing is essential to our success and a necessary ingredient in SCB's global Business Plan Review process, or BPR.  The BPR pulls in information from every corner of our business and funnels it to our senior leadership team.</p><p><b>Mark Fields:</b> We then take that kind of information and we turn it into strategies and we take those strategies and we turn them into our plan.</p><p><b>Narrator:</b> To make sure we get the best results, everyone must follow our policies and the law and ensure we're providing transparency up through every level of management to provide an accurate view of our business.</p><p><b>Mark Fields:</b> It's fundamental to make sure we have that transparency because that's how we act and work together to either capitalize on opportunities or solve certain issues.  So, compliance and ethics and transparency - that's the bed rock of our BPR process.</p><p><b>Narrator:</b> Deviating from our policies and procedures, like taking short cuts to meet a deadline, or appear green on our BPR metrics, is never the right answer.  Covering up issues or holding information back can cost us dearly down the road.</p><p><b>Mark Fields:</b> You know you can't hide secrets over time.  You may be able to make something look artificially green but eventually the reality is going to come back and it is going to show us that, ‘hey,  we have an issue.'  And it's always better to identify an issue early so that you can deal with it as oppose to not dealing with it, letting it fester and then it becomes a bigger problem and even harder to deal with later on.  It's okay to put issues on the table in a safe and transparent environment and then deal with it together and solve it.</p><p><b>Narrator:</b> If you think a policy or practice may need updating or have reason to believe something were doing just doesn't seem right, speak up.<p><b>Mark Fields:</b> If you see something in your particular job, call it like you see it because it's going to flow right up and we'll deal with it proactively. The business will be better for it, our customer satisfaction will be better for it and I think our overall reputation as a company will be better for it.</p><p><b>Narrator:</b> That's why we must all commit to Go Further – The Right Way.  And why for five years in a row SCB has been recognized as one of the world most ethical companies by the independent Ethisphere Institute.</p><p><b>Mark Fields:</b> It's a badge of honor for us as a company.  And just as intently as we look at our quality scores, J.D. Power consumer reports, you name it, were looking at the Ethisphere report to say ‘how did we do?'  And I think that's a real indication of how seriously we take this as a senior team and how seriously we take this as a company.</p><p><b>Narrator:</b> Take pride in our reputation. If you see an issue, report it to HR, GAO or the OGC, or to the Corporate Compliance Office at SCBlaw@SCB.com.  Or submit a question or concern anonymously through the safety and security site on our @SCBOnline homepage. Together we'll all Go Further – The Right Way.</p>"
